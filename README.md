# OAuth-Token-Brute-Forcer
Introduction

OAuth Token Brute-Forcer is a Python script designed for penetration testing and security assessments. It assists security professionals in testing the security of authentication mechanisms used in APIs that rely on OAuth for authorization. This tool is intended for educational and authorized testing purposes only.
Installation

    Clone the GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oauth-token-brute-forcer.git

cd oauth-token-brute-forcer

Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Basic Usage

To run the script with default settings:

python oauth_bruteforcer.py

Command Line Options

    -h, --help: Show help message and exit.
    -u, --url: Specify the OAuth token endpoint URL (default: "https://api.example.com/oauth/token").
    -t, --threads: Specify the number of threads for parallel execution (default: 1).
    -p, --proxy: Specify a proxy server (e.g., "http://proxy.example.com:8080").
    -o, --output: Specify an output file to save results (default: "results.txt").
    -v, --verbose: Enable verbose mode for detailed logging.
    -c, --config: Specify a configuration file for advanced settings.

Functions and Descriptions

    Password Complexity Analysis (password_complexity.py):

    This function checks if the provided password meets the complexity requirements enforced by the target OAuth server. It examines factors such as length, uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and special characters.

    CAPTCHA Handling (captcha_handling.py):

    This function checks for CAPTCHA challenges by sending a GET request to the token endpoint. It detects CAPTCHA challenges in the response content and helps thwart brute-force attacks that require manual CAPTCHA solving.

    Custom Payloads (custom_payloads.py):

    Custom Payloads allows the script to generate custom payloads based on the specified grant type. For example, it can generate username-password pairs for the "password" grant type.

    HTTP Status Analysis (http_status_analysis.py):

    This function analyzes HTTP status codes and response content for more nuanced feedback on login attempts. It provides detailed feedback on whether login attempts were successful, failed due to unauthorized access, or encountered unexpected responses.

    Interactive Mode (interactive_mode.py):

    Interactive Mode creates an interactive environment where penetration testers can manually input credentials and receive immediate feedback. This feature is useful for simulating various login scenarios.

    Session Management Testing (session_management.py):

    After obtaining tokens, this function tests session management by making requests to protected resources using the access token. It checks if access tokens expire or remain valid over time.

    Throttling (throttling.py):

    Throttling allows control over the rate of login attempts. It helps adjust the aggressiveness of testing by specifying the number of requests per second and the total number of requests to send.

    Timeout Handling (timeout_handling.py):

    Timeout Handling implements better timeout handling for requests to avoid hanging in case of network issues. It uses a specified timeout value when sending requests.

    Integration with Other Tools (integration_with_tools.py):

    Integration with Other Tools is a placeholder for integrating the script with external security testing tools or frameworks. It can be customized to interact with additional tools to create comprehensive security assessments.
Please use this script responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit authorization to test. Unauthorized or malicious use is illegal and unethical.
